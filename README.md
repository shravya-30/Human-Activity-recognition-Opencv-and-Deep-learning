# Human Activity Recognition using OpenCV + Deep Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on building a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system that can classify different human actions such as walking, running, and sitting using video-based deep learning models.

The solution leverages computer vision techniques with OpenCV and deep learning architectures trained on the Kinetics-400 dataset.

## Problem Statement
Understanding human actions from video is a key challenge in computer vision, with applications in:

- Smart surveillance systems  
- Healthcare monitoring  
- Fitness & sports analytics  
- Human-computer interaction  

The goal of this project was to develop a model that can automatically recognize activities from video input.

## Approach

### 1. Video Preprocessing
- Extracted frames from video clips  
- Resized and normalized input frames  
- Converted video sequences into model-ready format  

### 2. Model Development
Implemented deep learning-based activity classification using:

- CNN-based feature extraction  
- Temporal modeling across frames  
- Activity prediction from video sequences  

### 3. Activity Classification
Predicted activities such as:

- Walking  
- Running  
- Sitting  
- Gestures (future scope)
